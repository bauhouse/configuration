## Installation

1. Upload the 'configuration' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.
2. Enable it by selecting the "Configuration Settings" Extension, choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.
3. You can now edit the Configuration Settings file (/manifest/config.php) from within the Symphony administration interface.


## Usage

- A "Configuration" menu is added to the Symphony administration interface that provides an an "Edit Configuration Settings" page.
- The current version of Symphony is displayed on the "Preferences" page.
- Modify the Site Name on the "Preferences" page.

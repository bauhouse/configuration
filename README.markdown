2. Enable it by selecting the "Configuration Settings" Extension, choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.
3. You can now edit the Configuration Settings file (/manifest/config.php) from within the Symphony administration interface.


## Usage

- A "Configuration" menu is added to the Symphony administration interface that provides an an "Edit Configuration Settings" page.
